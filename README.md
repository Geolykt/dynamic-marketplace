**This fork has been abandonnend in favour of [Fluctis](https://github.com/Geolykt/Fluctis), which was written from the ground up**
You are still welcome to use this for your own adventure.

This is pretty much a plugin that has been written from the ground up but still follows the same goals, so there are incompatibillities with the upstream project.

## Building
The plugin can easily be built via maven, if you are looking at this project you know how already.

## Goals
- Cleaned source
- Integrated GUI
- Active development
